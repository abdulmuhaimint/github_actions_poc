# Github actions PoC

This repo contains code samples and github actions workflow for continuous integration of a nodejs project.  

**Tools used:**  
* jest (A Javascript testing framework)
* github actions
* nodejs

**Steps to follow**
1) create a \<workflow_name\>.yml file in ./.github/workflows directory
2) define the workflow inside  that file.  
3) push changes to git. 

That's it :smile:, everytime there is an event that is specified in the workflow, for example a pull request to main branch, jobs specified in the workflow will run.  

if any errors in the ci it will be reported on the pull request page or we can also setup a slack/email/discord etc notification to developer.

**Detailed explanation of workflow yml file**

```yaml
# name of the workflow
name: Node Continuous Integration

# on which event the workflow should run, here it is pull_request to main branch
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

# specify jobs, here test_pull_request is the custom name given to the job
jobs:
  test_pull_request:
    # on which vm to run
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # steps of the job, with uses command we can use pre built github actions.  
    # here actions/checkout, actions/setup-node are two prebuilt actions available on the github actions marketplace.
    # actions/checkout is to copy our github repo to the vm
    # actions/setup-node as the name suggests is used to setup nodejs on the ci vm
    # run command for executing shell commands
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 12
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
      - run: npm run build

```
